Ans) Java Database connectivity.java mostly used in industry to develop Business application.common and general things required in a 
	 business application.

	 we store the business data for a typicall business application inside the RDBMS s/w.DBMS are excellent in data storege in secure and 
	 easily retrival manner but it is very poor in processing and presenting the data in user-understandable format.java is excellent in 
	 processing the data and presenting the data but java is very poor in storing the data(in java we can store the data using 
	 Serialization processing).so inorder to develop a powerfull business application we need to communicate our java application with the 
	 DB server
