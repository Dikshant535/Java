Q2/- What’s the difference between class lock and object lock?
Ans) 

	Class lock :
   ==============
   
   1) It can be used when we want to prevent multiple threads to enter the synchronized block in any of all available instances on runtime.
   2) It should always be used to make static data thread safe. 
   3) Multiple objects of class may exist but there is always one class’s class object lock available.
   
   
   Object Lock :
  ===============
  
  1) It can be used when you want non-static method or non-static block of the code should be accessed by only one thread
  2) It should always be used to make non-static data thread safe.
  3) Every object the class may have their own lock
