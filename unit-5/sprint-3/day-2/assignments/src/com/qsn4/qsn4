  	class ThreadA extends Thread{
		Common c;
		String name;
		
		public ThreadA(Common c,String name) {
			this.c=c;
			this.name=name;
		}
		
		@Override
		public void run() {
		
			c.fun1(name);
			
		}
	}
	
	
	class ThreadB extends Thread{
		Common c;
		String name;
		
		public ThreadB(Common c,String name) {
		
			this.c=c;
			this.name=name;
			
		}
		@Override
		public void run() {
		
			c.fun1(name);
		
		}
		
	}
	
	
	
	
	class Main{
		public static void main(String[] args){
			Common c=new Common();
			//sharing same Common object to two thread
			ThreadA t1=new ThreadA(c,"Ram");
			ThreadB t2=new ThreadB(c,"Shyam");
			t1.start();
			t2.start();
		}
