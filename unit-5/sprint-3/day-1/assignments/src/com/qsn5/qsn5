Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a Thread?
Ans)  
	Thread Class :
   ================
   
    1) It is a class.

	2) It can be used to create a thread.

	3) It has multiple methods such as ‘start’ and ‘run’.

	4) It requires more memory space.

	5) Since multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java, hence, after a class extends the Thread class, it can’t extend to any other 
	   class.

	6) Every thread creates a unique object and associates with it.	
	
	
	Runnable Interface : -
   =========================
   
	1) It is a functional interface.

	2) It can be used to create a thread.

	3) It has a single abstract method ‘run’.

	4) It requires less memory space.

	5) When a class implements the ‘runnable’ interface, the class can extend to other classes.

	6) Multiple threads can share the same objects.
