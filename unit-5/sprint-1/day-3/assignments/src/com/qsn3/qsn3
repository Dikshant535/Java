Q3) What is exception handling in java, Write the hierarchy of Exception class and, Mention some of the predefined Exception classes 
    at least 5, and the reason when those exception class object is generated in our application?
    
Ans) Exception Handling : In java exceptions are the objects of some of the classes(predefined classes)  created by JVM to represent the 
    ===================== corresponding logical error.
    
    There are 2 types of errors in java:

	1.syntax error: improper environment or syntactical error, it result in compile time error.
	  -------------
	
	2.logical error: for some type of logical mistakes, jvm would be unable to execute the application this result in logical error.
	  --------------
	  
	for each and every logical error, there are some predefined classes in java, whose object will be created by the jvm whenever it 
	encounters that corresponding logical error.  
	
	hierarchy of Exception :
   ---------------------------
   
   														Object
   														  |
   														  |
   													  Throwable
   													      |
   													      |	  
   			-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   			|																									  |
   			|																									  |
   		Exception																								ERROR
   		    |
   	   RunTimeException	    
   	   
   	   
   
   Predefined Exception Classes :--
  -----------------------------------
  
  	1) java.lang.ArithmaticException:- Thrown when an exceptional arithmetic condition has occurred. For example, an integer "divide by 
  	  -------------------------------- zero" throws an instance of this class. ArithmeticException objects may be constructed by the 
  									   virtual machine as if suppression were disabled and/or the stack trace was not writable.
  									   
  									   
	2) java.lang.NullPointerException:- Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object is required. These include:
	   --------------------------------  1. Calling the instance method of a null object.
  										 2. Accessing or modifying the field of a null object.
										 3. Taking the length of null as if it were an array.
										 4. Accessing or modifying the slots of null as if it were an array.
										 5 .Throwing null as if it were a Throwable value
										 
										 
	3) java.lang.ClassCastException :-  Thrown to indicate that the code has attempted to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not 
	  --------------------------------  an instance. For example, the following code generates a ClassCastException:
	  								     Object x = new Integer(0);
	  								     System.out.println((String)x);
 
 
	4) java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException:-   Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is 
	  -------------------------------------------  either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array. 
	  
	  
	  
	5) java.lang.InputMisatchException:-  Thrown by a Scanner to indicate that the token retrieved does not match the pattern for the 
	  ----------------------------------  expected type, or that the token is out of range for the expected type.
