Q1) Explain Type casting and its types with examples?
Ans) Type casting: The process of converting data from one data type to another data type is called as TypeCasting.
There are two types of primitive data types type castings.
1. Implicit Type Casting
2. Explicit Type Casting
1. Implicit Type Casting: The process of converting data from lower data type to higher data type is called as Implicit Type Casting.
For Example :  char c='A';
      int i=c;
      System.out.println(c+" "+i);
2. Explicit Type Casting: The process of converting data from higher data type to lower data type is called as Explicit Type Casting.
For Example :  byte b1=30;
      byte b2=30;
      byte b=(byte)(b1+b2);
      System.out.println(b);

Q2)
Ans)package com.masai;

public class Demo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		String city = "Delhi";
		switch(city) {
		case "Mumbai" :
			System.out.println("Financial City");
			break;
		case "kolkata":
			System.out.println("City of Joy");
			break;
		case "Delhi":
			System.out.println("Capital of the country");
			break;
		case "Banglore":
			System.out.println("Cyber City");
			break;
		default : 
			System.out.println("May be other Indian City");
			break;
		}

	}

}

Q3) Explain the difference between local and instance variables?
Ans) instance variable is a variable that is declared in a class but outside a method, while a local variable is a variable declared within a method or a constructor.
