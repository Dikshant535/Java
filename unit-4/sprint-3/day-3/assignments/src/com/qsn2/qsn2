Q3) What is the use of ‘this’ and ‘super’ keywords in java ? Explain with an example?
Ans) 

	this:
	-----
	1) this keyword mainly represents the current instance of a class.
	2) this keyword used to call default constructor of the same class.
	3) this keyword used to access methods of the current class as it has reference of current class.
	4) his keyword can be referred from static context i.e can be invoked from static instance. For instance we can write System.out.println(this.x) which will print value of x without any compilation or runtime error.
	
	
	super:
	------
	
	1) On other hand super keyword represents the current instance of a parent class.
	2) super keyword used to call default constructor of the parent class.
	3) One can access the method of parent class with the help of super keyword.
	4) On other hand super keyword can't be referred from static context i.e can't be invoked from static instance. For instance we cannot write System.out.println(super.x) this will leads to compile time error.
	
	
	class A {
   public int x, y;
   public A(int x, int y) {
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
   }
}
class B extends A {
   public int x, y;
   public B() {
      this(0, 0);
   }
   public B(int x, int y) {
      super(x + 1, y + 1);// calls parent class constructor
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
   }
   public void print() {
      System.out.println("Base class : {" + x + ", " + y + "}");
      System.out.println("Super class : {" + super.x + ", " + super.y + "}");
   }
}
class Point {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      B obj = new B();
      obj.print();
      obj = new B(1, 2);
      obj.print();
   }
}

output :
=========

Base class : {0, 0}
Super class : {1, 1}

Base class : {1, 2}
Super class : {2, 3}
