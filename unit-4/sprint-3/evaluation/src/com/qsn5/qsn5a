Question 5: a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why? 

interface A{ 

	int i = 111; 
	
} 

class B implements A{ 

	void methodB(){ 
	
		i = 222; 
		
	} 
	
}

Ans ) this is not complir successfully becouse in interface , intance variable is by default "static final" and we cant not assign the final varible .
