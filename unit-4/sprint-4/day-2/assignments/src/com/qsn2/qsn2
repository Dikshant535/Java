Q2) What is the difference between ArrayList and Array ?
Ans) 

	Array :
   =========
   
   1) An array is a dynamically-created object. It serves as a container that holds the constant number of values of the same type. It has a contiguous memory location.
   2) Array is static in size.
   3) An array is a fixed-length data structure.
   4) It is mandatory to provide the size of an array while initializing it directly or indirectly.
   5) It performs fast in comparison to ArrayList because of fixed size.
   6) An array can store both objects and primitives type.
   7) We use for loop or for each loop to iterate over an array.
   8) We cannot use generics along with array because it is not a convertible type of array.
   8) Array provides a length variable which denotes the length of an array.
   10) We can add elements in an array by using the assignment operator.
   11) Array can be multi-dimensional.
   
   ArrayList :
  =============
  
  1) The ArrayList is a class of Java Collections framework. It contains popular classes like Vector, HashTable, and HashMap.
  2) ArrayList is dynamic in size.
  3) ArrayList is a variable-length data structure. It can be resized itself when needed.
  4) We can create an instance of ArrayList without specifying its size. Java creates ArrayList of default size.
  5) ArrayList is internally backed by the array in Java. The resize operation in ArrayList slows down the performance.
  6) We cannot store primitive type in ArrayList. It automatically converts primitive type to object.
  7) We use an iterator to iterate over ArrayList.
  8) ArrayList allows us to store only generic/ type, that's why it is type-safe.
  9) ArrayList provides the size() method to determine the size of ArrayList.
  10) Java provides the add() method to add elements in the ArrayList.
  11) ArrayList is always single-dimensional.
