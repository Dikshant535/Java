Q2) Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method ?
Ans) 

	Hashcode :  A hshcode is an integer value associated with every object in java faciliating 
   ============	 to get this hascode value for an object we cab use the hascode() method in java.if we want the two object equal for that we have to
   write logic for that in that class with the help of override the hascode .
   
   example :
  ===========
  
  public int hashcode(){
  
  	return (Object.hascode(int,roll,name);
  
  };
  
  Equals : equals method compare two object variavle value if that is true then return true otherwise return false .
 ========== 	 
 
 Example :
===========

public boolean equals(object o ){

	return(this.getname.equal(o.getname);

}
