Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?
Ans) 
    1) Static Variable :
    ----------------------
    	1) A static variable can be accessed by static members as well as non-static member functions.
    	2) A static variable acts as a global variable and is shared among all the objects of the class.
    	3) Static variables occupies less space and memory allocation happens once.
    	4) A static variable is declared using static keyword.
    2) Non-Static Variables :
    ----------------------------
    	1) A non-static variable can not be accessed by static member functions.
    	2) A non-static variables are specific to instance object in which they are created.
    	3) A non-static variable may occupy more space. Memory allocation may happen at run time.
    	4) A normal variable is not required to have any special keyword.
